# EFT kill notifications

This tool allows you to recieve audible feedback after killing an enemy on EFT (video game) (Escape from tarkov).

Now u dont need to flank guys that you killed with a grenade.

## Installation

Download everything as a zip, unzip to a directory. Open CMD, cd into the directory and use either

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

```python
Just run the script after installation and play
```

## Legalities
Whilst this isnt technically legal by ToS or EulA of the game, it shouldnt get you into any trouble. It uses NVIDIA highlights to determine whether you killed someone or not. There is no memory modifications or injections of any kind.
